# Mod Organization

[EDIT - This blog is now outdated; see my new post on [feature classes](https://isaacscript.github.io/main/mod-feature).]

This is a short blog about how to organize a big Isaac mod - one that has thousands of lines of code. It's aimed at more experienced programmers who want to be the best coders that they can be, and not just get the job done as quickly as possible. The principles here are agnostic in that they equally apply to a mod written in TypeScript or a mod written in Lua.

Software has the problem where if you keep on adding things to it, eventually it becomes a Frankenstein monster - hard to manage and hard to understand. It is helpful to keep your mod code nice and organized so that it never reaches a state of unmaintainable spaghetti.

Small mods can be written in a single file - `main.ts` (for TypeScript) or `main.lua` (for Lua). But for bigger mods, you will want to split up your code into different files. For example, it makes sense for a mod pack that contains 10 items to have all of the code for each individual item live in a file dedicated to just that item. That way, you can leverage the `Ctrl + p` hotkey in VSCode to jump to the exact spot that you need to go. And if you need to fix a bug with item 1, then you don't have to go on a scavenger hunt throughout the entire repository - you can just focus all of your attention on the file called `item1.ts`.

And if an item/feature file has so much code that it gets to be 500-1000 lines, then consider splitting up that file into multiple files. Instead of having a file called `item1.ts`, you can have a directory called `item1` with child files based on the originating callback or some other distinguishing attribute. By keeping files small, `Ctrl + p` will always warp to where you want to go with lightning speed.

But how do you glue it all together? In general, there are two pretty good ways to organize a bigger mod.

<br>

## 1) Main --> Feature

Have all callback registration happen in the files dedicated to the item/feature.

This looks like:

```ts
// main.ts

import * as item1 from "./items/item1";

const mod = RegisterMod("My Mod", 1);

item1.init(mod);
```

```ts
// item1.ts

export function init(mod: Mod): void {
  mod.AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_UPDATE, postUpdate);
}

function postUpdate() {
  // Code here
}
```

Or, in Lua:

```lua
-- main.lua

local item1 = require("myMod.items.item1")

local mod = RegisterMod("My Mod", 1)

item1:init(mod)
```

```lua
-- item1.lua

local item1 = {}

function item1:init(mod)
  mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_UPDATE, item1.postUpdate)
end

function item1:postUpdate()
  -- Code here
end

return item1
```

<br>

## 2) Main --> Callback --> Feature

Have a separate file per callback that calls out to the individual mod features.

This looks like:

```ts
// main.ts

import * as postUpdate from "./callbacks/postUpdate";

const mod = RegisterMod("My Mod", 1);

postUpdate.init(mod);
```

```ts
// postUpdate.ts

import * as item1 from "../items/item1";

export function init(): void {
  mod.AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, main);
}

function main() {
  item1.postUpdate();
}
```

```ts
// item1.ts

// ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE (1)
export function postUpdate(): void {
  // Code here
}
```

Or, in Lua:

```lua
-- main.lua

local postUpdate = require("myMod.callbacks.postUpdate")

local mod = RegisterMod("My Mod", 1)

postUpdate:init(mod)
```

```lua
-- postUpdate.lua

local postUpdate = {}

local item1 = require("myMod.items.item1")

function postUpdate:init(mod)
  mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, postUpdate.main)
end

function postUpdate:main()
  item1:postUpdate()
end

return postUpdate
```

```lua
-- item1.lua

local item1 = {}

-- ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE (1)
function item1:postUpdate()
  -- Code here
end

return item1
```

In this way, we only invoke the `AddCallback` method inside of a specific callback file. (Usually, this means that there is only one callback registration per callback, but there can be more than one if the callback supports tertiary arguments. But there would never be more than one callback + tertiary argument pair.)

One advantage of having an extra degree of hierarchy is that you can more easily control the *order* of feature execution. This can be important for bigger mods. As a toy example, say that one item/feature takes away all items from a player at the beginning of a run, and another item/feature adds items to a player at the beginning of a run. In this case, you would need to ensure that the former feature is executed last. It's easy to accomplish this in a callback file.

Another advantage of having two degrees of hierarchy is that the execution flow is easier to analyze and troubleshoot. Inevitably, you will need to troubleshoot problems in your mod. By commenting out functions in a specific callback file, you have more fine grained control than by simply disabling the initialization of an entire item/feature.

Using TypeScript compliments this strategy because it ensures that everything glues together properly.

In general, this is a great strategy to use in Isaac mods. It provides a nice separation of concerns and makes the code very easy to understand. Of course, every mod is unique, so you should think about a hierarchy that works for best your particular mod.

<br>

## Naming Feature Functions

In Isaac, callbacks are the root of nearly all code. So, when opening up a feature file, make the path to the function clear to the reader - name it **exactly** after the name of the calling callback function:

```lua
-- item1.lua

local item1 = {}

-- ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE (1)
function item1:postUpdate()
  -- Code here
end

return item1
```

By looking at this file, we can immediately tell that this code is invoked from the `MC_POST_UPDATE` callback. We don't have to go on a scavenger hunt to find out exactly the situations that this code can run in.

If the same function is used in multiple callbacks, you might be tempted to write code like this:

```lua
--[[ in file: postUpdate.lua ]]--
item1:doThing()

--[[ in file: postEntityKill.lua ]]--
item1:doThing()
```

But now we've lost the ability to know what's happening by looking at the `item1.lua` file. Instead, let's be more explicit and self-documenting:

```lua
--[[ in file: postUpdate.lua ]]--
item1:postUpdate()

--[[ in file: postEntityKill.lua ]]--
item1:postEntityKill()

--[[ in file: item1.lua ]]--

-- ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE (1)
function item1:postUpdate()
  item1:doThing()
end

-- ModCallbacks.MC_POST_ENTITY_KILL (68)
function item1:postEntityKill()
  item1:doThing()
end

function item1:doThing()
  -- Code here
end
```

<br>

## Use Functions to Provide a High-Level Inventory

As programmers, we are trained to use functions to stay [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself). In other words, whenever code needs to run more than one time, we stick it in a function to keep from repeating ourselves. But this isn't the only use for functions. Even if code is only run one time, we can still stick it in a function.

Say that item 1 does three things on every room. When writing the code for it, you might be tempted to put all of the code inside of the `postNewRoom()` function. Or, we could write it like this:

```lua
-- item1.lua

local item1 = {}

function item1:postNewRoom()
  item1:removeAllGridEntities()
  item1:spawnRocks()
  item1:spawnExtraEnemies()
end

function item1:removeAllGridEntities()
  -- Code here
end

function item1:spawnRocks()
  -- Code here
end

function item1:spawnExtraEnemies()
  -- Code here
end

return item1
```

This code has a nice property: by reading the `postNewRoom()` function, we get a high-level inventory of the things that happen. If we want to figure out what the function is doing, we *don't* have to read through hundreds of lines of code. Instead, we can instead read the nice little three-line summary. If we want to, we can wade further into the child functions, but we don't have to - all of those implementation details have been abstracted away.

This strategy also makes it easier to find bugs. For example, if a function is named `removeAllGridEntities()`, and then we find a situation where the function does *not* remove all of the grid entities, then it is clear where the bug is. We can immediately tell from the name of the function that whoever wrote it originally intended it to remove all of the grid entities. On the other hand, if it was just a block of code in the middle of some other, bigger function, then determining that is not so clear.

As an aside, when I say "whoever wrote it", I mean to say that it might have been written by someone else on your team. But even if you don't work on a team, the "someone else" might be **you** from months/years ago. Either way, you are in the same situation, wondering about the true purpose of the code.

<br>

## Avoiding Global Variables

Beyond the two organizational strategies that were discussed above, there are other ways to organize a big mod. In particular, a lot of mods use global variables, which is the the naive way to split code up into several files. For example, in Lua:

```lua
-- main.lua

local item1 = require("myMod.items.item1")

myMod = RegisterMod("My Mod", 1) -- Initializing a global variable

item1:init()
```

```lua
-- item1.lua

local item1 = {}

function item1:init()
  myMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_UPDATE, item1.postUpdate)
end

function item1:postUpdate()
  -- Code here
end

return item1
```

In this way, you can avoid passing the mod object into a function, which reduces the complexity a little. But there are several disadvantages with using global variables.

<br>

### 1) Variable Scoping

Let's talk about variables. Each variable has a lifecycle. It is initialized at a certain point, modified at other points, and (sometimes) reset back to the initialized state at the end of its lifecycle (like at the beginning of a new run).

A small mod might have ten or twenty different variables. And keeping track of them in your head might be easy. You might have memorized where each variables is used. And you know that certain variables get reset in some places, and other variables can get reset in other places.

As you might have guessed, keeping track of variables in your head does not scale very well. In a big mod with thousands of variables, it is impossible to keep track. Just by looking at the name of a variable, you will have no idea where it is initialized, where it is used, and where it is reset. You need a segmentation strategy to stay organized.

<br>

### 2) Namespacing with a Global Variable

One way to stay organized is to use *namespacing* in combination with a global variable. For example:

```lua
-- item1.lua

myMod.item1 = { -- myMod is a global variable
  charges = 0,
  counters = 0,
}

function item1:activate()
  myMod.item1.charges = 0
  myMod.item1.counters = myMod.item1.counters + 1
end
```

This is a little gross, because we are now typing a fair amount of boilerplate every time we need to access or modify a variable. One way to get around this is to locally cache the reference:

```lua
-- item1.lua

local v = {
  charges = 0,
  counters = 0,
}
myMod.item1 = v

function item1:activate()
  v.charges = 0
  v.counters = v.counters + 1
end
```

Here, "v" is shorthand for "the variables relating to this file". This strategy works well, but it does not address the more concerning problem: the variables are *scoped* incorrectly. What does that mean exactly?

<br>

### 3) Uh Oh, Spaghetti Code

If item 2 has a synergy with item 1, then it is natural for item 2 to reach into the global variable and directly modify the variables for item 1. And if item 3 also has a synergy with item 1, then we can reach into the global variable again. And so on, until we have 10 synergies.

But now, when item 1 has a bug, how do we figure out what is wrong? The variables are being modified throughout our entire code base, so it is very difficult to keep track of the lifecycle of the variable. Instead of knowing that the bug *must* be somewhere in the `item1.lua` file, now we are off on a scavenger hunt throughout the entire codebase.

In this example, the *scope* of these variables is global - everything can touch them. This is what the term "spaghetti code" is referring to: everything connects to everything else. As coders, we should strive to not let things get this bad. We should aim to provide compartmentalized abstractions that make it easy to diagnose problems and manage complexity.

<br>

### 4) Informal Scoping

Once you realize that modifying variables everywhere leads to spaghetti code, we can be resolute and decide to *only* modify the item 1 variables in the `item1.lua` file. In other words, the variables are now *scoped* locally to the file. By exporting functions to expose functionality for a particular item, we can solve the spaghetti problem:

```lua
-- item1.lua

local v = {
  charges = 0,
  counters = 0,
}
myMod.item1 = v

function item1:activate()
  v.charges = 0
  v.counters = v.counters + 1
end

-- Exported function used by other mod features
function item1:discharge()
  v.charges = 0;
end

-- Exported function used by other mod features
function item1:addCounter()
  v.counters = v.counters + 1
end
```

This is referred to as "informal" scoping. Our code is now much easier to reason about and debug. However, it is still technically *possible* for another file to modify the variables of item 1. But everyone on the team could agree to not do that.

<br>

### 5) Formal Scoping

Informal scoping can work great. But it begs the question: why "agree" to code a certain way when we can leverage the Lua programming language to verifiably prove that the variables can never be modified? If we are going to be fastidious and only modify variables relating to item 1 in the `item1.lua` file, we might as well go the extra inch to just make them local variables to begin with.

To accomplish this, *all we have to do* is to simply delete one line from the previous code snippet:

```lua
myMod.item1 = v
```

And everything works in an identical way as before.

<br>

### 6) Thinking About Scopes

Rather than just shitting out a variable declaration, stop for a moment and carefully consider what the *scope* for your new variable should be. By default, you should scope a variable as local as you possibly can:

- Is the variable only used by one specific function? Then it should be scoped local to the function.
- Do a lot of functions in the same file use the variable? Then it should be scoped local to the file.
- Does the variable need to be modified by other mods? Then make it a global variable.
  - But this should be pretty rare. (And for some variables, it might make more sense to expose helper functions like `discharge()` and `addCounter()` like in the previous code-snippet.)

By carefully scoping all of our variables, we make it a lot easier to understand the code and greatly narrow the problem-space for any particular bug.

<br>

### 7) Resiliency

In the Isaac Lua environment, other mods will be able to access the global variables that you set. Sometimes, this is intentional - you are explicitly exporting functionality to be used by other mods. But a lot of the time, it's not intentional, and a mod is designed around using global variables as a means for all of the files to talk to each other.

Mods that are structured like this are at a risk of someone else reaching in and deleting or overwriting the global variables. In truth, this kind of thing is rare. But why take the chance? Refactoring global variables into local variables only takes a tiny amount of effort.

<br>

## Avoiding Side Effects

### 1) Definition

Some mods import files for "side effects", which means that instead of importing a file for a function or a variable, they just execute all of the code in the file:

```lua
-- main.lua
myMod = RegisterMod("My Mod", 1) -- Initializing a global variable
require("item1.lua")

-- item1.lua
myMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, postUpdate)
```

Immediately, we can see that this strategy only works if you are using global variables to connect the files together; dependency injection is impossible.

<br>

### 2) Lack of Namespacing

Another problem with importing files this way is that we lose track of where code is coming from. Consider the following code-snippet:

```lua
require("item1.lua")
require("item2.lua")
require("item3.lua")

foo();
```

Which file did `foo()` come from? Who knows! Now, we have to go on a scavenger hunt to find out. Instead, let's write the code with proper exports:

```lua
local item1 = require("item1.lua")
local item2 = require("item2.lua")
local item3 = require("item3.lua")

item2.foo();
```

Much better! We can clearly see that the function is coming from `item2.lua` file. This is *namespacing* in action.

<br>

### 3) Double Whammy

Another problem with importing for side-effects it that it's all or nothing. So an item that exposes functionality to other features is not a very good fit for this model.

For example, say that we are writing code for item 2 and we want to handle the synergy with item 1:

```lua
-- item1.lua
function charge()
  -- Code here
  -- This function is a global function and was instantiated because
  -- the file was imported for side-effects
end

-- item2.lua
function postNewRoom()
  charge()
end
```

This is the composition of the blunders from the previous two sections:
- Bad scoping: `charge()` can be invoked anywhere without explicitly importing it and there can be name collisions.
- Namespacing: Where is `charge()` coming from? It could be coming from anywhere.

Of course, this is kind of a contrived example, because we would never name a global function called `charge()`. Instead, we would name it `item1Charge()` so that it is more clear where it is coming from and what it is doing. This makes the namespacing problem less bad. But this has other problems. It's annoying to add this boilerplate prefix to every single function in the `item1.lua` file. And it's *redundant* to name a function `item1Charge()` in a file called `item1.lua` - that should be obvious. Using a prefix is a hack for not scoping the functions properly to begin with.

<br>

### 4) The "Require Surprise"

Side effects are even more insidious when a Lua module has a mixture of executing code and exported functions.

Say that we fix the problem with the previous code-snippet by exporting the specific `charge()` function:

```lua
-- item1.lua
local item1 = {}

local item3 = require("myMod.items.item3")

item3:setup()

function item1:charge()
  -- Code here
end

return item1
```

```lua
-- item2.lua

-- Handle the synergy with item 1
local item1 = require("myMod.items.item1")
item1:charge()
```

Here, the author of item 2 figured that all he was doing was charging item 1. But surprise! Unbeknownst to them, simply by requiring the file, it executed other code, and it affected item 3.

Due to how `require` caching works in Lua, this side-effect would only happen once, so it would likely not cause a bug at runtime. But writing code like this is confusing! It's hard to reason about code when importing some files has side-effects, and importing other files does not.

When coding, consistency is key - get in the habit of never having any side effects in your code. If all a file does is initialize some code, then wrap it in an `init()` function so that all of your files have consistent export types.
